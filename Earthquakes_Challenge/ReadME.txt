# Earthquake Analysis with Javascript Leaflet

Basil and Sadhana is creating earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. And, they would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map. 

And they are using Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

## Deliverable 1: Adding Tectonic Plate Data

We are adding the tectonic plate data using d3.json(). Then we need to add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

## Deliverable 2: Adding Major Earthquake Data

In this we are adding the major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and adding a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

## Deliverable 3: Adding an Additional Map

Adding a third map style to your earthquake map.
